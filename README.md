# drivegit

drivegit. A random idea I had that works as an adapter between Git and Google Drive so you can horrify people by telling them you store your code in Google Drive.

## How it works

You need to have `credentials.json` in the root directory of the project. You can get it from [here](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/js). You also need to have a `token.yaml` file in the root directory of the project (this is generated by the application).

## What it has

- Google Drive list
- Google Drive download
- Google Drive upload

## Todo

- Initialize a New Git Repository: Create a new Git repository and store it on Google Drive.
- Clone a Git Repository: Download a Git repository from Google Drive to the local machine.
- Push Changes: Commit changes to a Git repository and upload the updated repository to Google Drive.
- Pull Changes: Download updates to a Git repository from Google Drive.
- Branch Management: Create, list, delete, and switch between branches in a Git repository stored on Google Drive.
- Tag Management: Create, list, and delete tags in a Git repository stored on Google Drive.
- Conflict Resolution: Handle conflicts when pulling changes that conflict with local changes.
